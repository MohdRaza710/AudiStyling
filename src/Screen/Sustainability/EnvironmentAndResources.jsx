                <p className='env-description1'>Audi has the vision to become net carbon-neutral* throughout the company by 2050**. To this end, thousands of employees are working each day to make the automotive value chain, the product portfolio and production processes more sustainable and to reduce the impact on the environment. Three fundamental aspects on the way to the goal: decarbonization, electrification and circular economy.</p>
                <p className='env-point1'>*: Audi regards net carbon neutrality as a state in which, following the exhaustion of other possible measures aimed at reducing the still remaining CO₂ emissions caused by the products or activities of Audi and/or currently unavoidable CO₂ emissions within the scope of the supply chain, manufacturing and recycling of Audi vehicles, at least quantitative compensation is provided through voluntary and globally conducted compensation projects. Throughout the utilization phase of a vehicle, meaning from when a vehicle is delivered to a customer, CO₂ emissions produced are not taken into account.</p>
                <p className='env-point1'>**: To achieve net carbon neutrality, Audi has defined a transformation pathway with clearly defined interim targets that depend heavily on market developments and the pace at which electric mobility is expanded. Volatile markets and the uncertain economic and political climate stand in the way of making reliable statements about interim targets up to the year 2050.</p>
